      <description>How to Study   Start early! Remember, you should be staying on pace with the lecture schedule. It will not be a fun experience if you wait until a day or so before the exam to start your work.
  Review your Online Homework problems. As you complete the homework problems, write down your full solutions with explanations in a neat, organized notebook. This way when exam time comes, you have a nice solutions manual, you created yourself - that you can then refer back to if you get stuck on a problem.</description>
