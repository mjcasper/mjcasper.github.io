	"content": "How to Study   Start early! Remember, you should be staying on pace with the lecture schedule. It will not be a fun experience if you wait until a day or so before the exam to start your work.\n  Review your Online Homework problems. As you complete the homework problems, write down your full solutions with explanations in a neat, organized notebook. This way when exam time comes, you have a nice solutions manual, you created yourself - that you can then refer back to if you get stuck on a problem. Again, get started early! A day or so before the exam should be spent reviewing homework problems, not looking at them for the first time.\n  Review your notes. As you watch the lectures, you should be taking detailed notes in a neat, organized notebook. You can then retry any of the examples as additional practice. The possible exam questions that we have listed in the study guides follow the notes pretty closely.\n  Review the Additional Practice Textbook problems. These are listed in the Exam Study Guides and are a more focused subset of problems chosen from the already-assigned ungraded textbook problems.\n  Review the Ungraded Textbook Homework problems. Being successful on the exams really comes down to practice, practice, practice.\n  Start early! Did I mention this already?\n  Difficulty The questions you will see on the exams are, on average, slightly easier than the online homework questions. This is by design:\n  It is better to be over-prepared than under-prepared. Having more-challenging homework questions better prepares you for the task of answering questions in a timed setting like an exam.\n  Some interesting questions are best asked in a homework setting where you have more time to let them fully digest.\n  Exam Format Each exam will consist of two parts: a short-answer section and a long-answer section.\nShort-Answer Questions These are designed to test basic comprehension and understanding of the material. Each is worth 1 point and will be graded as either correct or incorrect.\n You will only state your answer for these problems. You will not need to show your work. A few of these questions may ask for you to only state a result, definition, or name a theorem. Some of these questions may require minimal work, with calculations that can be done in your head. e.g. Evaluate a function or compute a derivative using the power rule.  Long-Answer Questions These are designed to test a deeper understanding of the material. Each of these is worth 3 or more points with the possibility of partial credit.\n You will show your work for these questions in addition to stating your answer. These questions will be graded on whether: All Work is Shown, the Answer is Correct, and Correct Mathematical Notation is used. These are essentially the questions that require more work to arrive at the answer.  "

	"content": "Overview Welcome to the online section of MTH 121 Survey of Calculus and Its Applications 1. We begin by giving a brief overview of the course structure and will then expand on these descriptions later in this handbook. Make sure you carefully read through both the entire course handbook and syllabus and if you still have any questions, contact your instructor immediately.\nEssentially, the course consists of five main components: lectures, recitations, office hours, homework assignments, and exams.\nLectures Lectures are pre-recorded videos that can be watched at any time. Each video has an accompanying note sheet to be filled in as you watch each lecture. These note sheets are for your benefit and may be checked for completion. To stay on pace with the course material, you are strongly encouraged to complete each lecture on (or before) the scheduled due date.\n See the Attendance Policy for further information. See the Guided Lectures section to start working!  Office Hours Office hours are conducted through both an online discussion board and in-person meetings.\nThe online discussion board is an opportunity to engage with the instructor, teaching assistant, and other students by asking and answering questions in a text-based format.\nThe in-person office hours are small-group meetings with the instructor (or teaching assistant), held on a recurring basis at scheduled times.\nRecitations Recitations are conducted as an online video conference, and are an opportunity to engage directly with the teaching assistant by asking questions, working through homework problems together, and reviewing lecture material - all in real time!\nHomework Assignments The best way to learn mathematics is by practicing it for yourself. Homework will consist of both graded and ungraded problems. The graded homework sets for each lecture will be completed online using WeBWork.\nExams There will be three midterm exams and one cumulative final exam. These exams are paper-based and must be taken in-person at an instructor approved testing center. Please note the exams are not administered online but rather in a paper-based format.\n"

The discussion board is an opportunity to engage with the instructor, teaching assistant, and other students by asking and answering questions in a text based format. We will be using the website Piazza for our course Discussion Board. It will require a very quick initial registration and is free to use.\nWe encourage you to post your questions during normal business hours (9-5pm ET) as these are the times we will be most active. It is our goal to have all questions answered within 24 hours during the work week (but most likely much sooner).\n Join the Discussion Board  How To Participate To join our discussion board simply click the above button. Once you have registered there are many ways to participate. You can ask questions, you can answer questions, you can just read through other discussions. It is up to you!\nWe do encourage you to also answer other people's questions; explaining a concept to someone is actually a really good way to learn and retain the information for yourself! (Although do not just simply give the answer!)\nSome Relevant Course Policies  Attendance Policy Office Hour Policy  How to Format Your Question Any question posted on the discussion board must adhere to the following conditions or it may be deleted.\n  Question Summary: This is essentially the subject line of your question.\n For homework related questions use the format: 2.5 Problem 4 corresponding to question number 4 from section 2.5. For other questions give a brief one-line description.    Question Details: This is essentially the body of your question. Ultimately, we need to see evidence that you have actually attempted the problem.The goal of this discussion board is to help you determine where you are getting stuck, not just give you the answer.\n Restate the entire problem from the homework. Provide at least a portion of your attempted solution. (You can also post photos). Explain where you think you are getting stuck and what the potential issue might be.    Repeated Questions: Ideally, there should only be one post per homework problem. Any subsequent questions should be posted as a follow-up discussion within the original post. This means before posting a question you should look at all old posts to see if it has already been asked.\n    \"A picture of the Piazza Question Interface. When posting a question students fill out Post Type (question or note), Folder (a tag for the question to help keep things organized), Summary (the subject line of the question), and Details (the main body of the question).\"   An Adequate Post Below is an example of what we would consider a good question. This is only meant to give you an idea of what we are looking for when you post a question; your post does not have to look exactly like this.\n  \"A picture of a student\u0026#39;s Piazza Question showing all formatting criteria adequately addressed.\"   Okay, so why is this such a good post?\n The question summary follows the correct format: 16.7 Problem 1. The student includes their actual homework problem (usually there is some randomization here, so everyone's problems are slightly different). The student includes a photo of their attempted solution (we cut off some of the photo here for brevity). In their actual question, the student has given some explanation as to what they believe is correct in their work and what might be the issue.  An Inadequate Post Below is an example of what we would consider an inadequate question. These are the types of questions that usually elicit our stock response of: Can you post your work? Remember your instructor cannot usually read minds \u0026hellip; we need to see what you are doing!\n  \"A picture of a student\u0026#39;s Piazza Question missing most of the correct formatting criteria.\"   What did the student get correct here?\n The question summary follows the correct format: 3.4 #8. The student includes their actual homework problem.  Alright, so what is missing?\n The student does not include their attempted solution, typed out or as a photo. (Remember we can't read minds!). The student does not give an explanation as to what they believe is correct in their work and what might be the issue. Actually, the student does not even ask a question here! Remember: The goal of this discussion board is to help you determine where you are getting stuck not just give you the answer.  "

Click the appropriate sign-up link to generate the email.\nYou can register for either a one-timemeeting or a recurring, weekly meeting. If you do register for the recurring, weekly meeting, you are expected to attend each week, as space has been limited to ensure small sizes.\nYou can also just \u0026ldquo;walk-in\u0026rdquo; to the in-person office hour meetings, but seating preference will be given to the students registered for that time.\nIn-Person Office Hour Times    Day Time Location Sign Up Links     Monday 1:30pm - 2:00pm Room 222 Math Building One-Timeor Recurring   Monday 2:00pm - 2:30pm Room 222 Math Building One-Timeor Recurring   Monday 2:30pm - 3:00pm Room 222 Math Building One-Timeor Recurring   Tuesday 11:30am - 12:00pm Room 222 Math Building One-Timeor Recurring   Tuesday 12:00pm - 12:30pm Room 222 Math Building One-Timeor Recurring   Tuesday 12:30pm - 1:00pm Room 222 Math Building One-Timeor Recurring    Some Relevant Course Policies  Attendance Policy Office Hour Policy  "

	"content": "Academic Integrity Students must be familiar with and abide by the university’s policies and procedures on Academic Integrity. Any violation of this policy will be pursued to the fullest extent of university policy.\nAttendance Policy   Technological Attendance: We will be using UBlearns and UBmail (email) for all official course communications. It is required that you check both of these platforms daily.\n  Lecture Attendance: You are expected to watch all assigned lecture videos in their entirety by the assigned lecture date. Attendance records will be kept and used when evaluating make-up exam requests.\n Satisfactory Lecture Attendance: is defined to be a completion rate of 90% or higher for each week's lecture videos by the assigned due date. The completion rate is the amount of time spent watching the video relative to the total length of the video.    Recitation and Office Hour Attendance: Attendance in the recitations and office hours (discussion board) is initially optional although highly recommended.\n  Attendance Policy Rider The instructor reserves the right to make lecture and/or recitation and/or office hour attendance a mandatory requirement for any student whose average in the course drops to a C+ or below at any point during the semester. You will receive an email notification from the instructor if this happens to you. If you do receive such a notification you will be required to maintain one or both of the following:\n satisfactory lecture attendance (defined above) weekly attendance at a scheduled recitation or office hour  These additional requirements must then be met in order for you to take any applicable exams. In the event that you do not meet the attendance requirement as stated in the email notification, you will automatically receive a grade of 0 for that exam. The email notification will explicitly list all additional requirements and applicable exams.\nCalculator and Reference Policy   The Texas Instruments TI-30XIISis the only authorized calculator allowed on the midterm and final exams. If you are caught with any other type of calculator during an exam, you will receive a grade of 0 for that exam and an academic integrity case will be initiated.\n  Outside references of any kind (e.g., cheat sheets, note cards, textbook) are not allowed on the midterm and final exams. If you are caught with any type of outside reference during an exam, you will receive a grade of 0 for that exam and an academic integrity case will be initiated.\n  Copyright Policy All course material is protected under applicable copyright law and the academic integrity policy of the university.\n Unauthorized Distribution: Reproduction and distribution of material is prohibited without the instructor's consent. Copies may be made for private, individual study, but should not be shared with unauthorized users. Unauthorized Possession: Posession of any material from previous courses is prohibited.  Any violation of this policy will be pursued to the fullest extent allowable by law and university policy.\nCurve Policy All grades are calculated as described in the grading section of this syllabus. There is no curve in this course. Homework assignments and exams are designed to assess your individual understanding of the learning outcomes. Your grade is completely within your control and based solely on your performance.\nEmail Policy It is required that your university (buffalo.edu) email address be used for all official course email correspondence.\nWhile we encourage everyone to ask questions, email should only be used for personal matters. Any questions related to the course that are not of a personal nature should be asked on the discussion board or during recitation or in-person office hours. Please allow 72 hours during the work week for a response from the instructor. Emails will not be answered over the weekend.\nExam Date and Time Policy  Date: All exams must be taken on the scheduled exam day. Time: All exams must be started at the scheduled time. If you have another class during the scheduled exam time, you must notify the instructor of this conflict through the Exam Registration Form.  Exam Location Policy It is the student's responsibility to find a testing facility, schedule an appointment with this facility, and obtain instructor approval of their arrangements. The testing facility does not need to be the same for every exam.\nEvery student has two options for where to take each exam :\n  On-campus at UB - This is included with your tuition.\n If you are taking an exam at UB, the testing arrangements have already been made for you. However, you still need to fill out the exam registration form.    An approved testing facility outside of UB - The testing site might charge an extra fee.\n The testing facility must be located in the US or Canada. The testing facility should be in a university or college although alternative locations will be considered on a case-by-case basis. In almost all cases, public libraries and high schools are not acceptable test sites and will not be approved. The testing facility should have a dedicated, unbiased proctor that will be present for the duration of the exam.    Exam Make-up Policy Make-up exams will only be given in the event of an emergency situation, religious holiday, or conflict with another regularly scheduled class. Please note that \u0026ldquo;having a cold\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not feeling well\u0026rdquo; does not constitute an emergency situation. In addition to a compelling and serious reason, all make-up exam requests must meet the following requirements:\n Written Documentation: All requests for a make-up exam must provide written documentation of the situation. If you cannot provide written documentation, you will not be allowed to make-up the exam. Student Health Services (Michael Hall): Does not formally excuse students from class and does not provide supporting written documentation. Any request for a make-up exam with only Student Health Services as a reference will be denied. Satisfactory Progress: Any student requesting a make-up exam should be making satisfactory progress in the course at the time of their request. This means they should have satisfactory lecture attendance and at least a 70% Guided Lecture average on the applicable assignments. Any student below either of these thresholds will have their request denied. Timeliness: All exams must be made up by the end of the 1st business day following the date of the original exam. This deadline may be extended at the instructor's discretion for truly extenuating circumstances.  Exam Registration Policy Everyone, regardless of where they are taking the exam, needs to complete the exam registration form.\n Failure to complete the exam registration form by the required deadline and subsequently obtain instructor approval of your exam arrangements will result in an \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; in the course.  Exam Regrade Policy Any request for an exam regrade must be made within 10 business days of the original exam date.\n This is a complete regrade of the exam, with the possibility that questions originally marked correct might be changed to incorrect (so it is possible that your exam score might go up, stay the same, or be lowered in the process).  Exception Policy Requests for exceptions to any policy or grading assessment described in this syllabus will not be granted. This is to ensure that all students are given equal opportunity to succeed in this class and are all graded by the same set of standards.\nFees Your chosen testing site might charge you an extra fee for their proctoring services. This fee is the student's responsibility. If you take the exams at UB there is no fee beyond the normal fees charged with your tuition.\nLate Policy All assignments are due by the posted due date and time. Late submissions will not be accepted; deadlines will not be extended for any reason.\n Do not save homework assignments until the last minute. There might be a slight difference in the server clock time with your local clock time.  Once a problem set closes, it will not be reopened for any reason.\nOffice Hour Policy Participation with the discussion board and office hours in general is initially optional and will not be graded; although it is highly recommended. If your average in the course drops to a B- or below at any point during the semester this policy may be changed at the instructor's discretion. Please see the Attendance Policy and Attendance Policy Rider for further details.\nYou can post questions on the discussion board at any time. However, please be advised that questions will usually be answered during normal business hours (9-5pm). It is our goal to have all questions answered within 24 hours during the work week (but most likely much sooner).\n  If you choose to participate in the discussion board it is expected that:\n You are up-to-date on all lecture material and readings. Your discussion board post follows all correct formatting guidelines.    If you choose to participate in the in-person office hours it is required that:\n You have both watched and taken notes on the lecture material up through that day. You come prepared with your notes and some attempted homework solutions, all nicely organized. The instructor reserves the right to check your lecture notes for completion at any time during office hours. You may be asked to leave if your notes are found to be incomplete.    Recitation Policy Attendance is initially optional and will not be graded; although it is highly recommended. If your average in the course drops to a B- or below at any point during the semester this policy may be changed at the instructor's discretion. Please see the Attendance Policy and Attendance Policy Rider for further details. If you choose to participate in a recitation it is required that:\n You have both watched and taken notes on the lecture material up through that day. You come prepared with your notes and attempted homework solutions readily available.  Please be aware that:\n The instructor reserves the right to check your lecture notes for completion at any time during the recitation. You may be asked to leave if your notes are found to be missing or incomplete. Each online recitation will be recorded and posted in the Recitation Archive.  "
