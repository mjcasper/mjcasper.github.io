Essentially, the course consists of five components: lectures, recitations, office hours, homework assignments, and exams.

## Lectures

Lectures are pre-recorded videos that can be watched at any time. Each video has an accompanying note sheet to be filled in as you watch each lecture. 


## Recitations

Each recitation is conducted as a live, online video conference. This gives everyone the opportunity to engage directly with the instructor by asking questions, working through homework problems together, and reviewing lecture material - all in real time! (The recitations are also recorded - in case you need to go back and review anything.)


## Office Hours

Office hours are conducted through an online discussion board. This is an opportunity to engage with the instructor and other students by asking and answering questions in a text-based format. (You can also post pictures of your work, if you get stuck on a problem.)






## Homework Assignments

The best way to learn mathematics is by practicing it for yourself. Homework will consist of both graded  and  ungraded problems. The graded homework sets for each lecture will be completed online. 



## Exams

All exams for the course are paper-based and must be taken **in-person** at an instructor approved testing center. Please note the exams are not administered online but rather in a paper-based format.
