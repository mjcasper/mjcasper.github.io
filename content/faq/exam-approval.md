+++

All students will complete an exam registration form at the beginning of the course. This form serves two purposes:

1. It allows students a chance to communicate with the instructor where they plan on completing their course exams.

2. For students looking to complete their exams off-campus, it gives them the opportunity to submit their off-campus testing center for instructor approval.

## Requirements

Once the course begins, the instructor will go through and individually approve all chosen off-campus testing centers subject to the following conditions:

  - The testing facility must be located in the US or Canada.
  - The testing facility should be in a university or college, although alternative locations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
  - The testing facility should have a dedicated, unbiased proctor that will be present for the duration of the exam. 
  - The testing facility should have a dedicated room, explicitly for testing.

(In almost all cases, public libraries and high schools are not acceptable test sites and will not be approved.)
