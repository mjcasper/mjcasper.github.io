## Resources

To help locate an off-campus test site we have a few recommended resources:

- Our list of [past test sites in New York State](#past-test-sites-in-nys)
- [National College Testing Association (NCTA)](http://www.ncta-testing.org/interactive-map)
- [SUNY Exam Proctoring System](https://www.asa.stonybrook.edu/suny/eps/Student/FindATestCenter)

These are only recommendations meant to give you a starting point in your search; you are free to use other testing centers not listed in these resources.

### Comments About These Resources

- These websites should only be used to help locate a potential testing center and its contact information. 
- **You should *not* use them to schedule your appointments**. Instead, contact the testing center directly to schedule your appointments.
- On the NCTA website you can disregard where it says "Testing Center Certified". This distinction is irrelevant for our purposes.
