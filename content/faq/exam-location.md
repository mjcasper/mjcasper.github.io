The exams for the course are conducted **in-person**, either at UB or an instructor approved off-campus testing center. Essentially, every student has two options for where to take each exam :

## On-campus at UB

This is included with your tuition.

  - If you are taking an exam at UB, the testing arrangements have already been made for you.



## An approved testing facility outside of UB

The testing site might charge you an extra fee. 

If a student decides to use a testing center outside of UB, it is the student's responsibility to:

- find a testing facility
- schedule an appointment with this facility
- obtain instructor approval of their arrangements


### Requirements for a testing center


Once the course begins, the instructor will go through and individually approve all chosen off-campus testing centers subject to the following conditions:

  - The testing facility must be located in the US or Canada.
  - The testing facility should be in a university or college, although alternative locations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
  - The testing facility should have a dedicated, unbiased proctor that will be present for the duration of the exam. 
  - The testing facility should have a dedicated room, explicitly for testing.

(In almost all cases, public libraries and high schools are not acceptable test sites and will not be approved.)
