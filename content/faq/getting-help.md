The two primary ways of getting assistance in the course are the recitations and online discussion board.


## Recitation

Everyone is encouraged to join our online video recitations. Each one is held live, so you can ask us questions in real time. We do also record them - this way you can go back and rewatch all of the old recitations.

## Office Hours

We also hold office hours on our online course discussion board. This is another way you can ask us questions if you get stuck on a homework problem or an example from lecture.  (You can also post photos of your work - so we can see where you might be running into trouble).
